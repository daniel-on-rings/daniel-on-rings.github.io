Before applying for University, Machine Learning was this mystified term.
It had me imagine Math-Wizards weaving some kind of network that resembles a brain.
And to no wonder, a lot of the public receptions on AI related topics live in in the realm of wonder, skepticism and even fearfulness.
All three perspectives hold merit. 
Unfortunately I often encounter people that tend to side with only one of them.

Currenly we're in what's called an "AI Summer" ([AI Winter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter)), a period of time where theres a lot of public, economic as well as academic interest in the field of Artificial Intelligence.

Thus numerous people in academia, often self-taught, spend a huge amount of time trying to get a foot in the field of Machine Learning.
Stupid amounts of money flow into further, often 'incremental', research and Model optimization.

There are a lot of public resources available discussing that point and its problems.
Theres an interesting [podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwhBtvCNwxo) on youtube discussing the current buzz in Machine Learning.

My own limited perspective is that we need not continue trying to brute-force our way towards improvements in AI but need to focus on broadening 
the discussion.
Exchange of views between Enthusiasts and Skeptics of AI may help attaining important perspectives in the field of Machine Learning.
